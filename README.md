The app is a time management application, which is specifically created for pastors, that is why it contains a lot of pastor-specific details. Basically this application helps the user to find a work - life balance in life. 
It focuses on 3 parts : work, family, and private time. 
For each part the user can use pre-defined cards, or create new cards which represents an activity. 
If the activity was done the user can swipe the card right, meaning it is done.
Later on in the statistics screen the user can observe how many cards did he/she finish during the week.
